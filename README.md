# Vehicle Models and LQR Feedback

A short collection of jupyter notebooks giving an explanation and alternative view of vehicle models and how we might naively go about controlling them. 

---

The jupyter notebooks in this repo can be run locally with 

*Python >= 2.7
*numpy
*matplotlib
*scipy

They contain a Kinematic bicycle model and dynamic bicycle model and a few simple maneuvers that
are followed using a linear time varying (LTV) linear quadratic regulator. 

The idea is to build some intuition and the limitations of these models and a naively applied control strategy. 

Although these models are well understood and there are a variety of resources that discuss them, I that is always helpful to have another perspective in an interactive format (that runs on light-weight Open-source software).
